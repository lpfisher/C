C supports several variables including:
--Integers - whole number that are either positive or negative (defined with char, int, short, long, or long long)
--Unsigned Integers - whole numbers which can only be positie (defined with unsigned char, unsigned int, unsigned short, unsigned long, or unsigned long long)
--floating point numbers - real numbers; including fractions. (defined with float or double)
--structures

The way a variable is declred defines its bounds.

-char - -129 to 127
-long - -2,147,483,648 to 2,147,483,647

C does not have boolean variables. These can be defined as follows:

define BOOL char
define FALSE 0
define TRUE 1
