In an effort to begin contributing to the linux kernel, writing my own drivers, and better understanding the core functionality of Linux, I'm studying C via learn-c.org and will be continuing to pursue pursue projects to further that effort. The notes from each lesson are in /notes, the source code for each exercise is in /source, and the compiled code for each exercise will be kept in /compiled. Once I move on to other exercises the /source and /compiled will be maintained.

Current lesson:
~~Arrays and pointers~~



(Dynamic Allocation exercise did not work. May return to this later)
