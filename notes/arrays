Arrays are variables that hold more than one value organized with an index.

int numbers[10]; <- Defines an array of 10 integers

Array indices start at 0 and arrays are filled the same way variable values are assigned

numbers[0] = 10;
numbers[1] - 20;
numbers[2] - 30;
numbers[3] - 40;
numbers[4] - 50;
numbers[5] - 60;
numbers[6] - 70;
numbers[7] - 80;
numbers[8] - 90;
numbers[9] - 100;

To recall the 7th number in the array, you would reference numbers[6].
printf("The seventh number in the array is %d", numbers[6])
