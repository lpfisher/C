static is a keyword in C that can be used with variables and functions.

By default, variables are specific to the scope in which they are defined. Variables can be declared as static to increase their scope up to the file containing them. As a result, these variables can be access anywhere inside a file.

** see statics-test.c for example **

The difference between statics and globals is that globals can be accessed from outside of the file.

-Static functions-
By default, functions are global. By declaring a static function, we restrict the scope of that function to the file that it is contained in.

static void fun(void) {
  printf("This is a static local function.");
}
