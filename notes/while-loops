While loops are similar to for loops, but less functional. They continue executing a block of code as long as the condition is true. 

int n = 0;
while (n < 10) {
  n++;
}

This will increment 'n' from 0-9 then exit the loop.

While loops can also be infinite:

while (1){
  /* code */
}

**Loop directives

Break - Break stops a loop before the termination condition is met.

int n = 0;
while (1) {
  n++;
  if (n == 10) {
    break;
  }
}

Continue

int n = 0;
while (n < 10) {
  n++;

  if (n % 2 == 1) {
    continue;
  }

  printf("The number %d is even.\n", n);
}
